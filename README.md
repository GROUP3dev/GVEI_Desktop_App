## Project Overview
The **Green Vehicle Exchange Initiative (GVEI)** is a government-led program in Rwanda designed to promote the transition from fuel-powered vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs).  

This **Java AWT desktop application** helps manage vehicle registration, exchange eligibility, government subsidy offers, and reporting.

**Benefits:**  
- Citizens receive cleaner, cost-efficient vehicles.  
- The government reduces carbon emissions and recycles old vehicles.
